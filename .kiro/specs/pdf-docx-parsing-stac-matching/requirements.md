# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing security requirements analysis Chrome extension by adding the capability to parse PDF and DOCX attachments, extract their content, and match against the STAC (Security Testing and Analysis Cases) knowledge base to provide more accurate and comprehensive security analysis. The system will intelligently handle different scenarios: parsing attachments when available, reading webpage markdown content when no attachments exist, and providing user selection when multiple attachments are present.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want the system to automatically detect and parse PDF/DOCX attachments from product requirement pages, so that I can analyze security requirements from document attachments without manual content extraction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects PDF or DOCX attachments on a webpage THEN it SHALL extract and parse the content from these files
2. WHEN multiple attachments are detected THEN the system SHALL prioritize PRD (Product Requirements Document) files based on filename patterns
3. WHEN attachment parsing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback to alternative content sources
4. WHEN no attachments are found THEN the system SHALL automatically fall back to webpage text content extraction

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want the system to handle multiple attachment scenarios intelligently, so that I can efficiently select the most relevant PRD document for analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN more than two attachments are detected THEN the system SHALL present a user selection interface
2. WHEN the user selects a specific attachment THEN the system SHALL parse only the selected document
3. WHEN attachment names contain PRD-related keywords THEN the system SHALL highlight these as recommended selections
4. WHEN no user selection is made within a reasonable time THEN the system SHALL default to the first PRD-related attachment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want the parsed content to be matched against the STAC knowledge base, so that I can receive targeted security requirements and test cases based on known security scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is successfully parsed THEN the system SHALL analyze it against the STAC knowledge base
2. WHEN STAC scenarios are matched THEN the system SHALL retrieve corresponding security requirements and test cases
3. WHEN no STAC scenarios match THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this to the user
4. WHEN partial matches are found THEN the system SHALL present both matched and unmatched scenarios

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want the system to use AI generalization for unmatched scenarios, so that I can still receive security analysis even when the STAC knowledge base doesn't cover specific use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN STAC knowledge base matching fails or is incomplete THEN the system SHALL use AI to generate security requirements analysis
2. WHEN AI generalization is used THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between STAC-based and AI-generated content
3. WHEN both STAC matches and AI generalization are available THEN the system SHALL present them in separate, clearly labeled sections
4. WHEN AI analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL indicate confidence levels or limitations where applicable

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want all development work to be performed in a separate feature branch, so that the main codebase remains stable during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN development begins THEN all code changes SHALL be made in a dedicated feature branch
2. WHEN the feature is complete THEN it SHALL be merged to main branch only after proper testing
3. WHEN conflicts arise during development THEN they SHALL be resolved in the feature branch before merging
4. WHEN the feature branch is created THEN it SHALL follow the naming convention: feature/pdf-docx-parsing-stac-matching

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want the system to provide clear feedback about STAC knowledge base coverage, so that I can understand the completeness and reliability of the security analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN STAC matching is performed THEN the system SHALL display coverage statistics
2. WHEN scenarios are not covered by STAC THEN the system SHALL list these gaps clearly
3. WHEN STAC knowledge base is used THEN the system SHALL indicate which specific scenarios were matched
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL differentiate between STAC-derived and AI-generated recommendations
